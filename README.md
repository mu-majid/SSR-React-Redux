  - I will use React, with redux and React Router, Also, topics like authentication will be discussed.

## Why?

  - How traditional React app works?

    1. The browser makes a request to the server (hosting the app), and an html document is returned by the server
    2. The html document has a script tag with `src` to the entire react app as a bundle (bundle.js).
